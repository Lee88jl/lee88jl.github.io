# GitHub Pages Personal Bio

In this activity, you will deploy the bio pages you created in the previous activity to GitHub  Pages.

## Instructions

* Now that we have gone over how to create a personal website using GitHub Pages, it’s your turn to publish the bio you created!

* Once your personal webpage is live, slack it out to the class.

## Deployment Guide

To deploy your webpage, complete the following steps:

1. Create a new repository named `_username_.github.io`.

2. Navigate into a folder on your computer, and clone the repository into it.

3. Add an HTML file named `index.html`, and code out a basic webpage (or use a previous page).

4. Add, commit, and push your changes to the repository.

5. Navigate to `_username_.github.io`, and you will find that your new webpage has gone live.

## Bonuses

* Add a few new pages to your website, which can be visited by clicking relative path links on your `index.html` page.

* Add extra elements, and build your page out further: Give it some pop!
